/*
This csp PAT file is responsible for generating a moveset which will achieve a goal
based on the robot's current interpretation of its environment. It expects world.csp
to be updated with the robot's current understanding of hostiles, survivors, and
visited squares.

It defines two types of moves for every direction (up, left, right, down). These
are visited/unvisited variants, respectively intending to prioritise visiting
already visited locations or unvisited locations. When moving to a new location,
the location is marked as visited. If that location was a survivor, they are
"picked up" by incrementing a variable onBoard.

The robot's position is mainted by xpos and ypos.

It also defines three core goals. These are:
home:
This goal simply attempts to bring the robot back to its home position, as given
by SUB_HOME_X and SUB_HOME_Y provided in world.csp.

goalAreaChecked:
This goal attempts to mark all locations as visited, and to return to the home position
during the process.

noSurvivors:
This goal ensures that all locations are void of survivors if there are remaining spaces
on the bot (onBoard != maxCapacity). In the case that the bot has reached maximum carrying
capacity, survivors are left on the board. In both cases, there is the additional goal of
returning the robot back home.
